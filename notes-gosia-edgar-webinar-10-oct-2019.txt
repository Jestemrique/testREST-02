10 Oct. 2019:
Notes about webinar preparation:

- Get familiar with code:


Remember: you just to download the "_site" folder and set the proper options in index.html file.
One thing I forgot to tell you in my last email. When playing testing the code you might need to reset everything and start over serveral times. You can do that by removing the local storage information saved by the application. In Chrome you just need to open Developer Tools -> "Application" -> "Local Storage". then remove the mstrInfor object so you can start from scratch.

To have a decent amount of dossiers to test we would need:

- New VM to use in the tests and presentation.
I've just created vm we can use: 10.23.1.180

- It would be a good thing to have 5 projects minimum (We could duplicate Tutorial project and rename it)

- Have several dossiers in each project and share them to Library.10 dossiers per project minimum would be a good start point.

- In each dossier we need to take care of setting the appropriate properties: Cover image, description. I will check if there is any other property we would need.

I would need you to download the _site folder and play with it.

- once you have played with the two files, we can meet and go through the code next Monday so that we can prepare presentation workflow. Think about different ways to present it (copying pasting code, brief explanations before each code fragment, etc.)

- Though we're not going to use the tools I was using to create the html, it would be a good thing if you want to have a look at them in case we want to do some changes on the fly.

Can we schedule a meeting next Monday so we can clarify any question or make some comments, etc... Would it be ok after lunch so you would've had time to play with the code?

I think that's all.

Let me know if I'm missing sth.

See you on Monday.
E.
